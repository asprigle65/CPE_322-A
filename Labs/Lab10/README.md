# Lab 10 - Blockchain

-Continued using Git Bash \
-General note: After completing all of these labs, I can say I feel much more proficient in using GitHub and I can more fully appreciate what it offers.

"""
https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED
If PYTHONHASHSEED is not set or set to random, a random value is used to to seed the hashes of str and bytes objects.
If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for generating the hash() of the types covered by the hash randomization.
Its purpose is to allow repeatable hashing, such as for selftests for the interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share hash values.
The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295]. Specifying the value 0 will disable hash randomization.

https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/hash
hash(object) returns the hash value of the object (if it has one). Hash values are integers.
They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup.
Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value even if they are of different types, as is the case for 1 and 1.0.
For objects with custom __hash__() methods, note that hash() truncates the return value based on the bit width of the host machine.

print('The hash for 3.14 is:',hash(3.14))

# hash for string

Comparison:\
-The first 3 hashes (1, 1.0, and 3.14) were all the same\
-The last 3 hashes (pytthon, tuple of vowels, object of person) were different
